# Ultimate Crypto Advisor Bot Project Brief

## Overview
The Ultimate Crypto Advisor Bot is designed to protect and grow BTC and XRP baselines while managing staking for non-core assets. It will analyze markets using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning, integrating with Coinbase, MongoDB, and Discord.

## Key Features
1. **Baseline Management**  
   - Protect and grow BTC and XRP baselines.  
   - Respect deposit-based baselines.  
   - Never sell or stake core assets below baseline limits.

2. **Staking Management**  
   - Manage staking for non-core assets with user approval.

3. **Market Analysis**  
   - Use Monte Carlo simulations for market predictions.  
   - Implement machine learning for trend analysis.

4. **Integrations**  
   - Coinbase for trading operations.  
   - MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.  
   - Discord for notifications and user interactions.

5. **User Approval Mechanism**  
   - Require explicit user approval for new coins or high-risk trades.

6. **Modules**  
   - **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor asset performance and allocation.  
   - **Trade Execution**: Execute trades based on analysis and user commands.  
   - **Collateral Awareness**: Ensure sufficient collateral for trades and staking.
   - **Reporting**: Daily/weekly reports on performance and activities.

7. **Safety Features**  
   - Dry-run mode by default to simulate trades without execution.  
   - Implement rate limits to prevent abuse.  
   - Anomaly detection to identify unusual trading patterns.  
   - Kill switch for emergency shutdown.  
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for high-value actions.

8. **Webhook Endpoints**  
   - Support for webhooks to receive real-time updates and notifications.

9. **Dashboards**  
   - Create dashboards for visualizing portfolio performance and market trends.

10. **Notifications**  
    - Send alerts for significant market changes, trade executions, and approvals needed.

11. **Sentiment Analysis**  
    - Analyze market sentiment from social media and news sources.

12. **Reinforcement Learning**  
    - Implement reinforcement learning to improve trading strategies over time.
